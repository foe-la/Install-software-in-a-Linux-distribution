# Install-software-in-a-Linux-distribution
how to install and uninstall applications in Linux

In this lab activity, I’ll use the Advanced Package Tool (APT) and sudo to install and uninstall applications in a Linux Bash shell.

Installing Linux applications can be complex, but the APT package manager simplifies the process, allowing me to quickly and reliably manage applications in a Linux environment.

For this activity, I’ll work with Suricata and tcpdump as examples—two network security applications used to capture and analyze network traffic.

The virtual machine I’ll be using runs a Debian-based Linux distribution that works seamlessly with the APT package manager. Using a virtual machine ensures that any mistakes I make won’t damage a real system, and it gives me the flexibility to revert to a previous state if needed.

As a future security analyst, knowing how to install and manage applications on a Linux operating system is essential, and this lab will help me develop those skills!
